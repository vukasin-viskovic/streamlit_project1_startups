This is a work-in progress app whose goal is to make Exploratory Data Analysis a bit more interactive and interesting for the user. I've made a multipage Streamlit app, with custom CSS styling and many customizable plotting features.

The app also demonstrates how we can achieve a Jupyter-Notebook type presentations with Streamlit.

**Skills showcased** include working with Streamlit, Plotly and Pandas.
